# Pomodoro Timer

This [Pomodoro Timer](https://woojinv.github.io/pomodoro-timer-v2/) uses vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

It also utilizies web workers to keep track of time so that browser JavaScript throttling and/or memory saving for inactive tabs does not affect the timer component.

## TODO

- light/dark mode toggle
